Uncensored AI Models and Building a Hacking Assistant
Introduction
This guide covers a 25-minute presentation on leveraging uncensored AI models, also known as large language models (LLMs), to create an AI-powered hacking assistant. We'll explore what uncensored models are, how they differ from censored ones, and how to use them for hacking-related tasks. The session includes practical demonstrations, including a pseudo-uncensored system, a locally-run uncensored model, and a cloud-based setup for more powerful hardware.
What is an Uncensored AI Model?
An uncensored AI model is an LLM without guardrails, meaning it responds to queries without restrictions, even on sensitive or controversial topics. Unlike censored models, which are fine-tuned to avoid harmful or illegal content, uncensored models provide direct answers.

How Models Are Created: All LLMs start uncensored, trained on vast datasets. Guardrails are added during fine-tuning to shape their personality (e.g., helpful, sarcastic) or restrict responses.
Why Uncensored Matters: As hackers or security enthusiasts, we value unrestricted access to information. Censored models, like ChatGPT, may refuse certain queries, which can be limiting.
Use Case: Uncensored models allow us to explore hacking techniques or understand malicious actors' methods, which is critical for security professionals.

Motivation for Uncensored Models
Censored models often block queries like "How do I build a pipe bomb?" even in legitimate contexts (e.g., writing a novel). Early jailbreaking attempts could bypass these restrictions, but modern censored models are more robust. Uncensored models, however, run locally or on private setups, offering:

Freedom: Answer queries without corporate oversight.
Security Insight: Understand how malicious actors use AI for spearphishing or malware campaigns, which are already prevalent on the dark web (e.g., WormGPT, GhostGPT).

Demonstration 1: Pseudo-Uncensored Hacking Library
Overview
Using Google's NotebookLM (notebooklm.google.com), we can create a pseudo-uncensored hacking assistant by uploading hacking-related PDFs. While NotebookLM uses a censored model, the content we provide allows it to answer hacking-related queries that a standard model might block.
Steps to Create the Hacking Library

Find Hacking Resources:

Search for hacking tutorials or eBooks. A recommended source is Yhobb, an online magazine with a GitHub repository (e.g., search "100 best hacking PDFs" to find their repo).
The repo contains resources like Advanced Penetration Testing, Shellcoders, and Hacking Web Applications.
Download the zip file, extract the PDFs, and prepare them for upload.


Set Up NotebookLM:

Create a new notebook in NotebookLM.
Upload up to 50 PDFs (free version limit). For larger collections, organize into separate libraries (e.g., web hacking, shellcoding).
NotebookLM processes the PDFs and generates an overview of the library.


Interact with the Library:

Ask specific questions, e.g., "How can I write a Python script for blind SQL injection?"
The system references the PDFs and may provide code or techniques, though it might refuse highly sensitive queries.
Use the "Studio" feature to explore a mind map of concepts like penetration testing tools (e.g., John the Ripper).


Additional Features:

Mind Map: Visualize topics like tools, techniques, or specific software (e.g., John the Ripper for password cracking).
Study Guide/Briefing: Generate summaries or save notes for later use.
Audio Overview: Create a podcast-style discussion between two AI characters (optional).



Benefits and Limitations

Benefits: Quick setup (~10 minutes), access to specialized hacking knowledge, and ability to explore topics via mind maps or chats.
Limitations: Not truly uncensored due to NotebookLM’s underlying model. Some queries may still be blocked, and responses depend on the quality of uploaded PDFs.

Demonstration 2: Truly Uncensored Local Model with Ollama
Overview
For a fully uncensored experience, we can run an LLM locally using Ollama (ollama.com), a software that supports Mac, Linux, and Windows. Ollama allows you to run models privately without internet connectivity, ensuring data privacy.
Setup Instructions

Install Ollama:

Download and install Ollama (one-click install for Windows).
It runs in the background, ready to serve models.


Find Uncensored Models:

Search for models tagged "uncensored" or "ablated" (indicating removed guardrails) on Ollama’s model library or Hugging Face.
Examples:
Dolphin models (e.g., Dolphin Phi, Dolphin Mixtral): Generally uncensored.
Ablated models: Look for terms like "obliterate" in model names (e.g., Quinn Coder).
Model Size: Smaller models like Dolphin Phi (1.6 GB, ~1.5 billion parameters) work on modest hardware.


Run ollama list in a terminal to view downloaded models.


Run a Model:

Example: ollama run dolphin-phi.
The model loads on your CPU (no GPU required for small models) and provides a chat interface or API.
No internet connection is needed once the model is downloaded.



Key Features

Privacy: Fully air-gapped, ideal for sensitive queries (e.g., health, personal issues).
Cost: Free to run, only requiring electricity.
Context Window: Supports up to 2048 tokens (e.g., long queries with detailed instructions).
Offline Use: Works on planes or without Wi-Fi, as the model contains vast pre-trained knowledge.

Example Interaction

Query: Ask a hacking-related question (e.g., "How do I bypass a login page?").
Response: The model provides detailed steps or code, unrestricted by guardrails.
Verification: Always validate AI-generated code, as it may contain errors.

Hardware Considerations

Current Setup: A modest laptop with 16 GB RAM running a 2.8 billion parameter model (Dolphin Phi).
Limitations: Larger models (e.g., 7 billion parameters) are slow or unreliable on weak hardware.
Solution: Use a GPU or a cloud-based setup for better performance.

Demonstration 3: Cloud-Based Uncensored Model with Runpod
Overview
For users without powerful local hardware, Runpod (runpod.io) offers a cloud-based solution to run large uncensored models on high-end GPUs (e.g., RTX 4000).
Setup Instructions

Create a Runpod Account:

Sign up at runpod.io and add funds (~$20 minimum).
Example: $5–$10 spent over months for testing.


Deploy a Model:

Select a GPU (e.g., RTX 4000) and a template (e.g., vLLM Open AI).
Runpod generates a URL to access the model.
Use a script (e.g., chainlit runpod.py from the GitHub repo) to connect via a web interface.


Interact with the Model:

The cloud model responds like a local one but with faster performance and support for larger models.
Example: Run a 70 billion parameter model for complex tasks.



Benefits

Power: Access high-end hardware for large models.
Privacy: The instance is private, similar to a local setup.
Flexibility: Scale hardware as needed.

Understanding Model Names
Model names contain important information:

Example: llama3.2:1b-instruct-q4_k.
Breakdown:
1b: 1 billion parameters (small model).
instruct: Optimized for chat/task instructions.
q4: Quantization level (4-bit, low precision, suitable for weak hardware).
Higher quantization (e.g., q16, q32) offers better performance but requires more resources.


Other Terms:
text, code, image: Indicate model specialization.
ablated, obliterate: Indicate removed guardrails.



Use websites like caniusellm.com to check which models your hardware supports.

Conclusion
Uncensored AI models empower hackers and security professionals to explore unrestricted knowledge and build powerful tools like a hacking assistant. By combining local setups (Ollama), cloud hardware (Runpod), and curated libraries (NotebookLM), you can create a versatile, private, and uncensored AI system. Happy hacking!
